# Milestone 3

All logic components of our project are organized as follows:

* [`Globe.js`](../../globe.js): Main logic file of our website. Prepares the globe and coordinates all others javascript files.
* [`index.html`](../../index.html): Main HTML file of our website.
* [`helpers.js`](../../helpers.js): A file that contains all the helper functions that are used in globe.js
* [`slider.js`](../../slider.js): A file that contains logic for the slider.
* [`EventHandlers.js`](../../EventHandlers.js): A file that contains all the Event handlers that are used in globe.js and index.html
* [`styles.css`](../../styles.css): A basic css file.

## Installation and Deployment

Simply pull the project into your local and make sure you also pull all the contents of the dataset folder.
Then, you will need a local Server to run the code as our logic uses server specific instructions such as fetch. We recommend using the Live server extension of VSCode.
